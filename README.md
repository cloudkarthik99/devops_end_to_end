# devops_end_to_end

Goal: A low to no cost End-to-End deployment of Microservices applications with the best DevOps Practices. Less ClickOps more Automation is the target.

Plan for Infrastructure: 
- Cloud: AWS or GCP
- Kubernetes: Combined on-prem and EC2 managed K8s deployment
- CICD: Github Actions
- Registry: Private AWS ECR if its free
- IAC: Terraform
- DNS: I have my own Domain I bought 1 year back, will use that
- GitOps: Because I love it- ArgoCD it is

Self-Note: Never worked on coding. So zero knowledge with programming logic. Want to work on Coding part, may be go or python. Lets see how many working scripts I can write.

Notes:
Lets create the infra where it goes into hibernate mode, when not in use, like entire infra should go offline until I start hitting the website.


Lets see where will I land.
